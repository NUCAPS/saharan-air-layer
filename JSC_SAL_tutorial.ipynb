    "# MONITORING THE SAHARAN AIR LAYER USING SATELLITES\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is the Saharan Air Layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Saharan Air Layer (SAL) is a warm and dry pocket of air that originates over the Saharan Desert and propagates over the Atlantic. The SAL is typically located between 850-500mb and has very steep lapse rates, thus capping the moist, tropical marine air below. This can potentially suppress tropical cyclone formation. The SAL is a potential hazard because it can transport aerosols to populated regions across the Atlantic, reducing air quality over the Caribbean and eastern United States. This can increase allergies and asthma in sensitive populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The image above shows a SAL outflow on September 15, 2018 using the VIIRS instrument from the Suomi NPP satellite. This outbreak reached the Caribbean on September 20, 2018. The SAL can be detected from space by examining visible and infrared imagery from a variety of sensors on satellite platform, such as the ABI (GOES-16), SEVIRI (Meteosat-9/-10), VIIRS (Suomi NPP, NOAA-20), and AVHRR (MetOp-A, -B, -C). The horizontal extent of the SAL can be monitored using dust RGB imagery, channel differencing (e.g., 10.33 µm - 12.30 µm), and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals. Additionally, microwave and infrared sounding (CrIS, ATMS, AMSU, and IASI) are particularly useful for SAL monitoring because sounder products can detect both the horizontal and vertical distribution of the dry air mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is NUCAPS?\n",
    "The NOAA Unique Combined Atmospheric Processing System (NUCAPS) operationally produces atmospheric sounding products from the Suomi National-Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), NOAA-20, and MetOp series polar orbiting satellites. From each satellite, NUCAPS provides global, twice-daily scans and is available in near real-time. NUCAPS provides vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, and trace gases such as ozone, methane, and carbon monoxide.\n",
    "\n",
    "NUCAPS humidity profiles is useful for studying the vertical profile of the SAL and to verify model predictions for SAL propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I get NUCAPS datasets?\n",
    "For researchers, Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 NUCAPS data can be ordered from [NOAA CLASS](https://www.bou.class.noaa.gov/saa/products/search?sub_id=0&datatype_family=JPSS_SND&submit.x=24&submit.y=7), under the JPSS Sound Products (JPSS_SND) drop down menu.  For operational forecasters, NOAA-20 NUCAPS is available within 20 minutes in AWIPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I visualize NUCAPS datasets?\n",
    "The daily ascending and descending overpasses can be viewed online via the [NOAA/STAR](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/jpss/EDRs/products_Soundings_N20.php). Additionally, skew-T visualizations are routinely produced by [NOAA/OSPO](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/atmosphere/soundings/nucaps/pskewt/USACON.html) for NOAA-20, Suomi NPP, and MetOp series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a short tutorial on how to display NUCAPS using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. This tutorial is intended to be a beginner-friendly exercise. So, even if\n",
    "you are not a Python programmer, you may be able to port it to another\n",
    "language of choice.\n",
